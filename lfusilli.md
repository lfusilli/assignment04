# Rochester's Contribution to the World

Founded in 1788, the City of Rochester has been home to a wide variety of highly influential people. As a Rochester native, I've always been mildly interested in the contributions that this city and its inhabitants have given to the world. So after a little research, and some personal knowledge, I was able to come up with three people that I believe are the most influential. As it happens, all three have buildings within the realm of UR named in their honor. The first is the famous George Eastman. The father of modern consumer photography, visionary, and benefactor gave rise to the U of R. Next is Frederick Douglass, a slave-turned-statesman who became perhaps the most important figure in the fight to abolish slavery in the United States. And finally is Susan B. Anthony, the celebrated leader of the women's rights movement in the late 1800s.

## George Eastman

George Eastman (July 12, 1854 – March 14, 1932) was an American entrepreneur who founded the Eastman Kodak Company and popularized the use of roll film, helping to bring photography to the mainstream. Roll film was also the basis for the invention of motion picture film stock in 1888 by the world's first film-makers Eadweard Muybridge and Louis Le Prince, and a few years later by their followers Léon Bouly, William Kennedy Dickson, Thomas Edison, the Lumière Brothers, and Georges Méliès.

## Frederick Douglass

Frederick Douglass (born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey; c. February 1818 – February 20, 1895) was an African-American social reformer, abolitionist, orator, writer, and statesman. After escaping from slavery in Maryland, he became a national leader of the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts and New York, gaining note for his dazzling oratory and incisive antislavery writings. In his time, he was described by abolitionists as a living counter-example to slaveholders' arguments that slaves lacked the intellectual capacity to function as independent American citizens.

## Susan B. Anthony

Susan Brownell Anthony (February 15, 1820 – March 13, 1906) was an American social reformer and women's rights activist who played a pivotal role in the women's suffrage movement. Born into a Quaker family committed to social equality, she collected anti-slavery petitions at the age of 17. In 1856, she became the New York state agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society.

### Legacy

The Nineteenth Amendment, which guaranteed the right of American women to vote, was colloquially known as the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. After it was ratified in 1920, the National American Woman Suffrage Association, whose character and policies were strongly influenced by Anthony, was transformed into the League of Women Voters, which is still an active force in U.S. politics. Anthony's legacy makes an annual resurgence around election days in November, when many women in Rochester place their "I voted today" stickers on her grave in Mt. Hope Cemetary to celebrate and honor her effort.
