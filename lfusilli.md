# Rochester's Contribution to the World

Founded in 1788, the City of Rochester has been home to a wide variety of highly influential people. As a Rochester native, I've always been mildly interested in the contributions that this city and its inhabitants have given to the world. So after a little research, and some personal knowledge, I was able to come up with three people that I believe are the most influential. As it happens, all three have buildings within the realm of UR named in their honor. The first is the famous George Eastman. The father of modern consumer photography, visionary, and benefactor gave rise to the U of R. Next is Frederick Douglass, a slave-turned-statesman who became perhaps the most important figure in the fight to abolish slavery in the United States. And finally is Susan B. Anthony, the celebrated leader of the women's rights movement in the late 1800s.
